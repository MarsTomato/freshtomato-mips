.SH NAME
xl2tpd\-control \- xl2tpd control utility.

.SH DESCRIPTION
xl2tpd is an implementation of the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (RFC 2661).
L2TP allows to tunnel PPP over UDP. Some ISPs use L2TP to tunnel user sessions
from dial-in servers (modem banks, ADSL DSLAMs) to back-end PPP servers.
Another important application is Virtual Private Networks where the IPsec
protocol is used to secure the L2TP connection (L2TP/IPsec, RFC 3193).

xl2tpd works by opening a pseudo-tty for communicating with pppd.
It runs completely in userspace but supports kernel mode L2TP.

xl2tpd supports IPsec SA Reference tracking to enable overlapping internak
NAT'ed IP's by different clients (eg all clients connecting from their
linksys internal IP 192.168.1.101) as well as multiple clients behind
the same NAT router.
