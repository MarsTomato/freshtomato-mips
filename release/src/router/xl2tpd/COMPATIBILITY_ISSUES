* Android  9 & 10 fails on maximum retries exceeded for tunnel

There are reports that with Android 9 & 10, some users are getting "Maximum retries"
error messages. It seems to related to some of the phones not responding to
L2TP keepalive heartbeats

A possible work around is to use the max_retries option. Using "max retries"
in the xl2tpd.conf (e.g. max retries = 100) has known to work for some
users. Alternatively, another works around is to not to enable L2TP
keepalive on the VPN servers.

* Issues with Cisco ASA

Some users are reporting that newer version of xl2tpd (1.310 onward) are
not able to connect to Cisco ASA.

A possible work around is to use x2ltpd 1.39 and disable use of kernel module
(comment out the directive OSFLAGS+= -DUSE_KERNEL -D in the Makefile)
