Description: Small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server - system daemon
 Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure, DNS forwarder and DHCP
 server. It is designed to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a
 small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are
 not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS
 server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses
 to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or
 in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic
 DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.

Description: Small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server - executable
 This package contains the dnsmasq executable and documentation, but
 not the infrastructure required to run it as a system daemon. For
 that, install the dnsmasq package.

Description: Small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server - executable, Lua-enabled
 This package contains the dnsmasq executable and documentation, but
 not the infrastructure required to run it as a system daemon. For
 that, install the dnsmasq package. This package is an alternative
 to dnsmasq-base which includes the Lua interpreter.

Description: Utilities for manipulating DHCP leases
 Small utilities to query a DHCP server's lease database and
 remove leases from it. These programs are distributed with dnsmasq
 and may not work correctly with other DHCP servers.
