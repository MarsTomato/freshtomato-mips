# We run dnsmasq via the /usr/share/dnsmasq/systemd-helper script which acts
# as a wrapper picking up extra configuration files and then execs dnsmasq
# itself, when called with the "exec" function.

# The *-resolvconf functions configure (and deconfigure)
# resolvconf to work with the dnsmasq DNS server. They're called like
# this to get correct error handling (ie don't start-resolvconf if the
# dnsmasq daemon fails to start).
